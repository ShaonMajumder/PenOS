# PenOS v0.2.0

Summary
- Paging now uses dynamically allocated directories/tables from the bitmap PMM, keeps an identity window for low memory, mirrors the kernel into 0xC0000000+, and exposes mapping APIs.

Architecture changes
- Added recursive PDE slot for easier PD/PT introspection.
- `paging_map`, `paging_unmap`, and `paging_virt_to_phys` become public helpers.
- `paging_init` now logs status once CR3/CR0 are flipped.

 Files touched
- `include/mem/paging.h`
- `src/mem/paging.c`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/commits/feature-paging/1_dynamic_vmm.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION`, `docs/versions/v0.2.0.md`

Lessons learned
- Building paging dynamically requires a reliable PMM; the bitmap allocator enabled the redesign.
- Reserving the higher-half mapping early is a low-risk way to pave the path for future address-space isolation.

Next steps
- Layer a kernel heap on top of paging.
- Wire scheduler/syscalls to create per-task address spaces eventually.
