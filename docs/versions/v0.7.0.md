# PenOS v0.7.0

Summary
- Added a PS/2 mouse driver that enables the auxiliary device, handles 3-byte packets on IRQ12, updates an internal cursor/button state, and logs every movement for future UI work.

Architecture changes
- Driver issues classic PS/2 init sequence (enable aux port, update controller command byte, turn on streaming) and registers an IRQ12 handler.
- Packet parser tracks deltas/buttons and exposes `mouse_get_state` so higher-level code can query the latest reading.

Files touched
- `include/drivers/mouse.h`
- `src/drivers/mouse.c`
- `src/arch/x86/interrupts.c`
- Documentation (`README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/commits/feature-mouse/1_ps2_mouse.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION`, `docs/versions/v0.7.0.md`)

Lessons learned
- PS/2 controllers require careful command sequencing; always wait for status bits before writing data/commands.
- Logging movement immediately makes it easy to verify the driver in pure text-mode builds even before GUI work begins.

Next steps
- Buffer mouse events for consumption by future GUI code or expose them via shell diagnostics.
- Combine keyboard/mouse input into a higher-level input manager once the framebuffer lands.
