# PenOS v0.1.0

Summary
- First runnable image with GRUB boot, GDT/IDT, PIC remapping, PIT ticks, keyboard input, console shell, and sysinfo demo.

Architecture changes
- Added ISR stubs plus dispatching infrastructure bridging assembly and C.
- Added sequential PMM and identity-mapped paging.
- Introduced scheduler skeleton to receive timer notifications.

Files touched
- Build system (`Makefile`, `linker.ld`, `grub/grub.cfg`).
- Core sources under `src/` plus headers under `include/`.
- Documentation plus CHANGELOG plus VERSION.

Lessons learned
- Keep stack frame layouts documented when mixing assembly and C.
- Even stub allocators and schedulers provide seams for future versions.

Next steps
- Add kernel heap and higher-half mapping.
- Flesh out scheduler/tasks and begin filesystem integration.
