# PenOS v0.1.1

Summary
- Physical memory management now relies on a bitmap allocator that honours the firmware-provided map, reserves the kernel, and supports freeing frames for reuse.

Architecture changes
- Added bitmap data structure and helper routines to mark/test frames.
- `pmm_init` runs two passes over the Multiboot map: first to dimension the bitmap, then to release only usable regions.
- Allocation now tracks `search_hint` for faster scans and maintains a free-frame counter.

Files touched
- `src/mem/pmm.c`
- Documentation (`docs/commits/feature-pmm/1_bitmap_pmm.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION`)

Lessons learned
- Firmware metadata must be trusted over assumptions; parsing it early prevents overruns.
- Reserving the first MiB and kernel image keeps legacy devices and page tables safe.

Next steps
- Layer paging and heap allocators on top of the improved PMM.
- Expose telemetry (free frames) to diagnostics and future shells.
